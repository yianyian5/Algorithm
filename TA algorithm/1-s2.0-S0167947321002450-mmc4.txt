README

======= Main Files ======= 

Sec3Table3and5.m --- This code produces output that was used to create Tables 3 and 5,
as well as Figure 2.

Sec3Table4.m --- This code produces output that was used to create Table 4, as well as
Figure 3.

Sec4Ex1.m --- This code produces output that was used to create Table 6 and Figure 4.

Sec4Ex2.m --- This code produces output that was used to create Table 7 and Figure 5.

======= Important Notes ======= 
The files of the format AdjacencyMatrix#l#.txt are required to run the Section 3 code and
Section 4, Example 1 (this allows for quick neighbor lookup). These can be recreated using the get_adjacency_matrix.m function.

For Section 4, Example 2, the file EVD4.txt is needed.


======= Main Functions ======= 

find_emp_thresholds_v10.m --- Used to find empirical threshold sequence tr.
Inputs: number of components m, target sample size n, number of iterations ni, full design DF, full model matrix FullM,
adjacency matrix AD
Returns: An empirical threshold sequence tr, of length ni, to be used in the TA algorithm.
Alternate: find_emp_thresholds_v10b.m uses a for loop instead of parfor

TA_emp_thresholds_v10b.m --- Executes the TA algorithm. 
Inputs: target run size n, number of iterations ni, threshold sequence tr (of length ni), full design DF, 
adjacency matrix AD, row indices of initial design inidces_init
Returns: the model matrix of the optimal design

Federov_General.m --- Executes the modified Federov algorithm.
Inputs: number of components m, target run size n, random seed, full model matrix FullM
Returns: the model matrix of the optimal design
Alternate: Federov_General_v2.m allows for custom tolerance for convergence

OofA_Mix_Model_Matrix.m --- Used to construct the model matrix expansion.
Inputs: an OofA Mixture design matrix D, number of components m
model is either 'additive' [Model 5], 'interaction' [Model 6], or 'interaction2' [Model 7]
Returns: The model matrix expanison of D under the given OofA Mixture model
